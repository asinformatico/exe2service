# exe2service
Install a executable file has a service in Windows Operating Systems

Two Microsoft programs are required from the Windows Development Resource Kit, instsrv.exe and srvany.exe, which should be placed in the folder where we have the exe2.srv.au3 file before performing the script compilation.
We must also have in the same folder the file resources.au3 that will be responsible for adding both programs within the compiled exe that we generate.
Once this is done, we can run the gui to select our executables and turn them into Windows services.
